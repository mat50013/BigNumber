# BigNumber
--BigNumber library--

## About the library

**Limits**

->Numbers can have maximum 10000 of digits

**Operators working**

"=" = assigned a value(dont do like this : a = 2 ^ 10, make like this : a = 2; a = a ^ 10)

"^" = its like the pow() function(2 ^ 10 = 1024, the base can be a BigNumber but the exponent must be a long long or a int)

"+" = make the sum

"-" = make the diference(must be pozitive)

"/" = divide

operators ">" , "<", "==" are working for comparing to BigNumbers

**thats all**

**new thinks coming soon**

### ToDO

-> add sqrt function
